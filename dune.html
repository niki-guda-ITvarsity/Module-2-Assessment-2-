                        <p>Dune: Part Two is a 2024 American epic science fiction film directed and produced by Denis
                        Villeneuve, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jon Spaihts. The sequel to Dune (2021), it is 
                        the second of a two-part adaptation of the 1965 novel Dune by Frank Herbert. It follows Paul Atreides 
                        as he unites with the Fremen people of the desert planet Arrakis to wage war against House Harkonnen.</p>

                        and Javier Bardem reprise their roles from the first film, with Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken, Léa
                        Seydoux, and Souheila Yacoub joining the ensemble cast. Development began after Legend>rights for the Dune franchise in 2016. 
                        Villeneuve signed on as director in 2017, intending to make a two-part adaptation of the novel due to its complexity. </p> 
                        <p>Production contracts were only secured for the first film, with the second film having to be greenlit based on the first's success. Villeneuve was concerned about the sequel's certainty after 
                        the first film had a simultaneous theatrical and HBO Max release but Warner Bros. Pictures assured him the sequel would happen if it performed well on HBO Max. After the critical and commercial
                        success of the first film, Warner Bros. and Legendary green-lit Dune: Part Two in October 2021. Principal photography took place in Budapest, Italy, Jordan and Abu Dhabi between July and December 2022.</p>
                        <p>After being delayed from the November 2023 release date due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, the film had its world premiere at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square, London, on February 15, 2024, and 
                        opened in the United States on March 1. It received widespread critical acclaim and has grossed over $683 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2024. A third film, based on Dune Messiah, is in development.</p>
